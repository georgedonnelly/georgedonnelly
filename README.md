## Full Stack, Multi-VM Web3 Dev Crafting Real-World Dapps to Empower Real People
I architect and ship peer-to-peer trading protocols, remittance solutions and other real-world-use dapps on Ethereum, Solana and Bitcoin. I combine deep smart-contract expertise (Rust, Solidity, CashScript, Move) with modern front-end (React.js, Next.js, Solid.js, Astro) and scalable back-ends (Node.js, Ruby on Rails).

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do
- **Smart Contracts & Blockchain Infra**  
  ‚Ä¢ Rust + Anchor / Solana, Move
  ‚Ä¢ Solidity / EVM (Foundry, Hardhat)  
  ‚Ä¢ CashScript + Bitcoin Script / UTXO  
- **Web & Mobile Front-Ends**  
  ‚Ä¢ Next.js, React, Solid.js, Astro  
  ‚Ä¢ TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Radix  
- **Back-Ends & APIs**

- **DevOps & Infra**  
  ‚Ä¢ Docker / Podman, Kubernetes  
  ‚Ä¢ Postgres, MySQL  
  ‚Ä¢ AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, Supabase
